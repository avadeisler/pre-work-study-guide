## A study guide for the course work

This is a project that I created to introduce myself to coding as well as keep the information I learned in an organized and accessible place. Creating this page allowed me to learn and practice some of the basics of coding as well as make lots of mistakes that I could then learn to debug. Hopefully this guide can also help others understand some coding basics. It covers some tips on HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript.
